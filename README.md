# Simple-SQLite
Simple SQLite was created following the [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bpYHCKdZno&ab_channel=Digestible)
[SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) is one of the most popular options for lightweight databases, so it's a great candidate for use in a Unity application when you want something a little more robust than a structured text file (JSON, XML, YAML, etc.) or C#'s serialized objects.
